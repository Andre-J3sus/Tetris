# Tetris
A version of the game Tetris that I developed at my Programming class in college - LEIC11
The aim of this project was to test our coding skills at the online class.
The code is divided in 4 files .kt:
 - main.kt -> the main code of the game, with the main function and olher functions of the 3 other files and CanvasLib;
 - game.kt -> all information and fuctions directly related to the game; uses functions of piece.kt, blocks.kt and CanvasLib;
 - piece.kt -> information about Tetris pieces, also known as Tetrominoes; uses funtions of blocks.kt and CanvasLib;
 - blocks.kt -> information about the composition of the Tetrominoes, blocks; uses functions of CanvasLib.
