## Description

> A version of the game Tetris that I developed at my Programming class in college - LEIC11.

> The aim of this project was to test our coding skills at the online class.

## Files
The code is divided in 4 files .kt:
 - main.kt   -> the main code of the game, with the main function and olher functions of the 3 other files and CanvasLib;
 - game.kt   -> all information and fuctions directly related to the game; uses functions of piece.kt, blocks.kt and CanvasLib;
 - piece.kt  -> information about Tetris pieces, also known as Tetrominoes; uses funtions of blocks.kt and CanvasLib;
 - blocks.kt -> information about the composition of the Tetrominoes, blocks; uses functions of CanvasLib.

## How To Use
In this project we used several functions of CanvasLib, a library made by our teacher, so to run the code, it is necessary to download the folder "libs" and the file "build.gradle.kts".

When playing the game, you can move the pieces with the LEFT, RIGHT and DOWN arrows and rotate them with the UP arrow.
